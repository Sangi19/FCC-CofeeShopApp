## Deploy on Vercel:
- vercel Link - https://fcc-cofee-shop-app.vercel.app/

## Key things learnt:
  - Type Selector (Styles applied with the help of all the Tags such as h1,div,img...)
  - Class Selector (Styles applied with the help of classname)
  - To add background image (ex: ackground-image:url(https://pixabay.com/images/search/nature/)
  - To center div horizontally ( margin-right:auto; margin-left:auto)
  - To reduce body size (ex: width:80%)
  - To Align a text (ex: text-align: left/right)
  - To change a block level element (like paragraph tag which takes full length of the current line) to inline (display: inline-block)
  - Inline-block- takes the actual length of the content
  - Even space around content and sides (ex: padding-left: 20px; padding-left:20px)
  - Even padding to all the Top, Bottom, Left, Bottom(ex: padding:20px)
  - Same listing/alignment for wide and normal screen (ex: max-width:500px)
  - To change all the text in body (ex: font-family:sans-serif)
  - Fallbacks: it is used in instances where the initial (ex: font-family) is not found or available
  - hr element- to display a divider between sections of different content.
  - Font style, font size, line height, background color,border color
  - Pseudo-Selector: Style an element when a user mouses over it,  visited and unvisited links differently, when an element gets focus.
  - Pseudo-Selector for link:
      - a:visited {style}
      - a:hover
      - a:active
  - h1 tag has default margin top, to prevent it we can reduce top of margin (ex: margin-top:0)
  - Reduce space between the listed elements (ex: mt:1, mb:1)
